To whom it may concern that will be seeing this project as part of a portfolio:

This project was created as part of our 2nd Year Game Development Course at Carleton University. The End Project Report has more
details but this readme will attempt to provide a succinct summary.

WASD for movement
(W accelerates forward, S accelerates backwards, A and D accelerate left and right respectively)
Q and E can be used to quickly boost (or blink) your ship left or right respectively. 

Going out of bounds (in the mini asteroid fields to the left and right) will greatly impair your acceleration.
The larger obstacle asteroids on the map will also impair your movement should you collide with them.
The black holes will attempt to trap you in, but can be escaped if you aren't moving too slow.

Ship movement is physics based with regards to mass. The menu has several options regarding this.
You can change the mass of your ship, and choose from the 2 pre-set maps.
In addition, the Q and E boosting can be swapped for an alternative blink displacement movement instead.

We hope you enjoy the game and would love to answer questions regarding any of the mechanics.
